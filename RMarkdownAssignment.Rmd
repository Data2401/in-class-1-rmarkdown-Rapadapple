### Wise words

From Shakespeare:

> Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them.

Here is a [link](https://writingexplained.org/idiom-dictionary/some-people-are-born-great) for more information on that quote

### I Recommend Kanye West


 
Below the "Your work here" section header, do the following 3 things. To turn this in, knit the RMarkdown file, and zip and submit the html.  

1. Make a subsection called "Wise words". Put your favorite quote in a block quote. Add a functioning link to a website that provides more information about that quote.

2. Make a subsection called "My semester". Make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (put those in __bold__), course title (put those in _italics_), and instructor name.

3. Lastly, make subsection called "I recommend", and add some information about your favorite author or musician.

+ A _subsubheading_ with the name of the artist or author;    
+ An example of their writing or lyrics (formatted in a *plain code block*);   
+ A _list_ of things they have written or performed (remember to use the formatting markup for a list!).     


Note that you can click "Knit" as you go along to see what the final results are going to look like. **Once you're done, commit the changes and push the repo back to your assignment on GitHub!**
